LabeledFPOP paper

** Motivation

[[https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00759129][SegAnnot]] is a changepoint detection algorithm for data sequences with
labels, but it does not find changes that are not labeled. [[http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-016-9636-3][FPOP]] is a
changepoint detection algorithm which can find any number of changes,
but it ignores the labels. In this project we investigate a new
algorithm which combines ideas from both algorithms.

[[file:HOCKING-labeled-FPOP.pdf][New PDF]] contains V single subscript notation rather than D double
subscript notation, clarify what needs to be computed for positive
labels.
