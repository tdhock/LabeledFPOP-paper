LabeledFPOP paper

** Motivation

[[https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13967][LOPART]] = Labeled Optimal Partitioning is a changepoint detection
algorithm for data sequences which
- supports 0/1 labels, 
- each changepoint is unconstrained (can be either up or down),
- and is quadratic time in the number of data.

[[https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03646][GFPOP]]/[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00117][PeakSegDisk]] is a changepoint detection algorithm/package which 
- does not support labels,
- each changepoint can be constrained (non-decreasing, non-increasing),
- and is log-linear time in the number of data.

In this paper we investigate a new algorithm, FLOPART = Functional LOPART, which
- supports 0/1/up/down labels,
- each changepoint can be constrained (non-decreasing, non-increasing),
- and is log-linear time in the number of data.

** TODOs

Start with [[https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSegDisk][PeakSegDisk]] code and modify to support peak label
constraints.

[[file:HOCKING-labeled-FPOP.pdf][New PDF]] contains V single subscript notation rather than D double
subscript notation, clarify what needs to be computed for positive
labels.
