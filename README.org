LabeledFPOP paper

** Motivation

[[https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13967][LOPART]] = Labeled Optimal Partitioning is a changepoint detection
algorithm for data sequences which
- supports 0/1 labels, 
- each changepoint is unconstrained (can be either up or down),
- and is quadratic time in the number of data.

[[https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03646][GFPOP]]/[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00117][PeakSegDisk]] is a changepoint detection algorithm/package which 
- does not support labels,
- each changepoint can be constrained (non-decreasing, non-increasing),
- and is log-linear time in the number of data.

In this paper we investigate a new algorithm, FLOPART = Functional LOPART, which
- supports 0/1/up/down labels,
- each changepoint can be constrained (non-decreasing, non-increasing),
- and is log-linear time in the number of data.
  
** TODOs

- Time complexity comparison with PeakSegOptimal / LOPART.
- Accuracy comparison with PeakSegOptimal, similar to LOPART paper.

TODO more labels!!

This is a good motivating data set for the new algorithm. We can't
detect the small peak with the un-labeled algo until 13 peaks, and in
that model we end up with several big peaks in the data that have two
peaks where there should be one, and one peak on the left where there
should be none.

[[file:HOCKING-labeled-FPOP.pdf][New PDF]] contains V single subscript notation rather than D double
subscript notation, clarify what needs to be computed for positive
labels.
